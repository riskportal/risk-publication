## Documentation

Full documentation (with examples and usage guidance) is available at [https://riskportal.github.io/network-tutorial/](https://riskportal.github.io/network-tutorial/).

## Repository Structure

This repository contains the notebooks and data needed to reproduce figures from the RISK and SAFE analyses. The full RISK source code is available at [riskportal/network](https://github.com/riskportal/network).

### `risk_network/`

Jupyter notebooks and processed datasets for **RISK-based** clustering, annotation, and visualization:

- `fig_1_supp_fig_3_6_7_8.ipynb` â€“ Yeast PPI network analysis, RISK workflow overview, GO BP enrichment, and comparison to SAFE
- `supp_fig_1_4.ipynb` â€“ GI network analysis (RISK) and side-by-side comparison with SAFE
- `supp_fig_2_5.ipynb` â€“ RISK analysis of the full yeast PPI network and comparative clustering (RISK vs SAFE)
- `supp_fig_9.ipynb` â€“ RISK analysis of a high-energy physics citation network (non-biological validation)
- `supp_fig_10.ipynb`, `supp_fig_10.py` â€“ Benchmarking: execution time and memory usage for RISK (vs SAFE) using synthetic networks

### `safe_network/`

Jupyter notebooks and datasets for **SAFE-based** overrepresentation analysis and benchmarking:

- `supp_fig_3_4_5.ipynb` â€“ SAFE-based annotation and domain export for GI and PPI networks, including pruned/full networks
- `supp_fig_10.ipynb`, `supp_fig_10.py` â€“ Benchmarking: execution time and memory usage for SAFE (vs RISK) on synthetic networks
- `safepy/` â€“ Lightweight Python implementation of SAFE, includes core logic and utilities

## Installation

To run the notebooks locally, follow these steps:

### Step 1: Install Python 3.8+

Download and install Python 3.8 or higher from the [official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

> ðŸ’¡ **Windows Tip:** Check the box for **Add Python to PATH** during install. If you missed it, [this guide](https://datatofish.com/add-python-to-windows-path/) can help.

### Step 2: Create a Virtual Environment

- **Windows**

```cmd
python -m venv risk-env
risk-env\Scripts\activate
```

- **macOS/Linux**

```bash
python3 -m venv risk-env
source risk-env/bin/activate
```

### Step 3: Install Jupyter and Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install jupyter
```

### Step 4: Clone This Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/riskportal/network-publication.git
cd network-publication
```

### Step 5: Launch Jupyter Notebook

```bash
jupyter notebook
```
